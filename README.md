# BREAKOUT
Breakout is a classic arcade-style game created using C# and the Windows Forms Application framework. This project was a great way to learn the basics of C# programming and object-oriented design as well as gain experience in creating a UI with the Windows Forms Application framework. The game features an UI with smooth gameplay and challenging levels. Players control a paddle to hit a ball and break through a wall of bricks, earning points along the way.

## Features
* Includes all the basic functionnalities (moving ball, bricks, paddle, bounces, new randomized ball direction each game, etc.)
* 4 LEVELS : Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme
* The level 'extreme' features a paddle that is constantly in movement. (example: If Right arrow is pressed, the paddle will move to the right until the Left arrow is pressed.)
* Fully resizable form
* Countdown before the game starts
* Random image are assigned to each bricks when drawing them

## Technologies
* C#
* Windows Forms

## How to play
1. To run the game, simply double-click on the 'breakout.exe' file. This will launch the game and you will be able to play immediately. Make sure you have the latest version of .NET framework installed on your system to be able to run the game properly.

*Please note that running the game from the source code will require visual studio to be installed on your system and knowledge of how to build a C# Windows Forms Application.*

## Why Windows Forms Application ?
Windows Forms Application was chosen for this game project as it was a learning opportunity to familiarize myself with the technology. While it may not be the optimal choice for game development, it allowed me to deepen my understanding of C# and the Windows Forms Application framework. The project was completed as part of an User Interface class, and was a valuable exercise in creating a functional, interactive application. Despite the limitations of the technology, the end result is a fully-functional and entertaining game that showcases the capabilities of C# and Windows Forms.
